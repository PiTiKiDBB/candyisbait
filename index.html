        <h1>Honestly</h1>
            <p>
                You are not necessarily smart. You are not necessarily quick-witted. But you have a team of supporters and the best defense team money can buy. You are typically white, you are typically privileged. You have something to lose — don’t you always? — in the form of accomplishments, accolades, athletic scholarships or letters of recommendation, networking opportunities, job offers. The losses are always material, because committing a rape is about as inconvenient as having a fraudster get his hands on your bank account. It’s an unfortunate roadblock on the way to further achievement. The insertion of a finger, perhaps a penis, is equally transactional, and if it isn’t, it should be. A woman’s agency is the cheapest bargaining chip with which a court can play, and this will never be beyond your understanding.

                You look “normal,” whatever normal may be. Women do not fear you — they cannot fear you — because you are the physical embodiment of everything they are taught not to fear. You are not the boogeyman. You are not stranger danger. You are familiar. You are her friend, her brother’s friend, her sister’s friend. You are the neighbor from across the street. You are that old high school classmate she still runs into at the bus stop. You are that sweet pizza guy who she always tips extra. The statistics are unkind (82% of rapes are committed by a non-stranger, and 47% of rapes are committed by a friend or an acquaintance) but this won’t mean much. You’ve figured it all out. You’re a practical man. The odds are in your favor.

                The Stanford Rape Case is an example of a successful rape prosecution. That’s not saying much. Even then, the sympathy directed toward Brock Allen Turner, convicted of three felony charges, including sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object, is the mournful kind, the kind befitting a rising star lost in a sudden accident, and not a man caught in the act of raping someone behind a dumpster after a fraternity party. A Washington Post article on the verdict bemoans the loss of a potentially great contributor to society, at one point referring to his crime as a “stunning fall from grace.”
